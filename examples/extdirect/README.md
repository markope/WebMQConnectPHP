Accelerating Ext.Direct - Unlimited Concurrency
===============================================

*Tavendo WebMQ* is able to forward standard WAMP RPCs to any server exposing an Ext.Direct compatible API.

This requires no change to the backend server.

Doing so has a number of advantages:

 1. Unlimited concurrency
 2. Multiple sessions to *different* servers
 3. Only consumes 1 TCP connection
 4. Access from any WAMP client

Unlimited concurrency means that RPCs are executed not only asynchronously, but concurrently. RPCs that take a long time on the backend (for example, because running a database query) will not block subsequently issued RPCs. Results for RPCs will be delivered as soon as available.

Since *Tavendo WebMQ* uses *WebSocket*, it is possible to establish multiple connections to different servers on different domains from within the same HTML/JS. Ext.Direct Standard is only able to do this using JSONP, which has security implications when used cross-domain (and generally is a hack).

Further, with *Tavendo WebMQ*, only a single TCP connection is consumed per session. This reduces the load on browser, the network and the backend servers.

Since *Tavendo WebMQ* is based on WAMP, Ext.Direct servers can be accessed via RPC from any WAMP compatible client, which includes *AutobahnAndroid*. The latter allows to write native Android apps that issues RPCs onto Ext.Direct servers.


Ext.Direct Standard RPCs
------------------------

As can be seen from the following log, doing RPCs via standard Ext.Direct means hitting concurrency limits of the underlying mechanism.

The results for `TestAction.add` and `TestAction.doEcho` only arrive after seconds, since they are blocked by the previously issued calls to `TestAction.doEchoSlow`.

    Ext.Direct initialized.

Ext.Direct standard RPCs use HTTP/Ajax (via XmlHttpRequest object) and is limited by the number of concurrent connections a browser opens to a specific host.

That limit is built into browsers and fixed. The limit applies to *all* HTTP connections over *all* tabs a browser will open to a specific host, not only for `XMLHttpRequest`, but also for all other resource downloads (like for images, JS, CSS, etc).

The limit is most often **6 concurrent connections**. Actual limits for various browsers can be found [here](http://www.browserscope.org/?category=network).


Ext.Direct RPCs with Tavendo WebMQ
----------------------------------

Regarding concurrency, WAMP is able to issue multiple RPCs not only asynchronously, but also concurrently. That means that RPCs that run slow will not block subsequent RPCs.

This can be seen from the following log. Other that with standard Ext.Direct, doing RPCs via *Tavendo WebMQ*, the results for the calls to `TestAction.add` and `TestAction.doEcho` are not blocked by the slow running RPCs on `TestAction.doEchoSlow`:
